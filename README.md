Analyzed Heart Disease dataset using stdlib math functions. I used the normal probability density function(`normalPDF`) to visualize age distribution, `normalCDF` to measure cholesterol risk across clinical thresholds, and `z-test` to validate whether the dataset mean cholesterol is significantly higher than the healthy standard of 200 mg/dl, `ttest2` to compare cholesterol between disease and healthy patients and `pcorrtest` to check whether age and cholesterol are related.

## Age Distribution

I used `normalPDF` to visualize how patient ages are distributed.  
The average age is around **54 years**, meaning roughly half of the patients fall above this value, including those over 55, which is generally considered a higher-risk group for heart disease.

## Cholesterol Distribution

</p>

I used `normalCDF` to estimate what percentage of patients fall below standard clinical thresholds.  
The mean cholesterol level is **246 mg/dl**, which is already above the **240 borderline limit**.  
Only about **18% of patients** have healthy cholesterol levels (below 200 mg/dl).

## Hypothesis Testing

</p>

I used a `z-test` to check whether the dataset's mean cholesterol is significantly higher than the healthy standard of **200 mg/dl**.  
The test rejected the null hypothesis with a very low p-value, indicating that the difference is statistically significant and not due to chance.


Used `ttest2` to compare cholesterol levels between patients with heart disease and healthy patients. The result did not reject the null hypothesis `(p = 0.136)` meaning cholesterol is not a significant differentiator between the two groups.

Used `pcorrtest` to check whether age and cholesterol are linearly related in this dataset to see if older patients tend to have higher cholesterol level.



## Dataset

Heart Disease dataset (`heart.csv`) with 303 patients and 14 columns.

Columns used in this analysis:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
|`age`|Patient age (years)|
|`chol`|Cholesterol level (mg/dl)|
|`trestbps`|Resting blood pressure|
|`thalach`|Max heart rate achieved|
|`oldpeak`|ST depression from exercise|
|`fbs`|Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true)|
|`target`|Heart disease present (1 = yes)|
